# Splatoon 3 - Project Thunder
The largest Splatoon 3 modpack, featuring a port of every map from Splatoon 1 & 2.

I have since quit modding, and opened this repository as a way to archive.
Ranging through the commit history, you can find all development stuff we went through.
Aswell as the tools we've used for various things.

If you'd like to find me in other modding areas, I've moved on to much more healthier communites, like Hytale.

Thank you all for supporting this mod! <3
