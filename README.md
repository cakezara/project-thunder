# Splatoon 3 - Project Thunder
The largest Splatoon 3 modpack, featuring a port of every map from Splatoon 1 & 2.


### Notice ⚠️
I've left the community of Splatoon 3 Modding overall, since it's a hellhole (like many mod communities ngl), but
I still will focus some time to updating or adding onto this mod when I feel like it, which typically are in blips
cuz #hyperfixation alert! Anyway, that's all:

If you'd like to find me in other modding areas aswell, you can check me out on bsky:

Thank you all for supporting this mod! <3
