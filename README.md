The skiddest Splatoon 3 modpack, featuring a port of every map from Splatoon 1 & 2.

I have since quit modding because I couldnt help but manipulate someone for private hacks, and opened this repository as a way to archive.
Ranging through the commit history, you can find all development stuff we went through.
Aswell as the tools we've used for various things, hopefully notihng related to my diaper fetish.

If you'd like to find me in other modding areas, I've moved on to much more healthier communites where my AI slop can spread its wings, like the game made to sit in the bottom corner of youtube shorts, Hytale.
