# Why did we choose to split from Redux entirely?

Our motivation at the time was struct, and the project leads weren't much in our favor past the point 
of Custom Scenes. We feel we could do a more accurate and better job split from the project as a whole,
and starting off strong by instead delaying release until nearly all maps are ported 100%.

- I, zara, personally work better independently on these types of projects, as people aren't as reliable
as myself. :3 (Literally did 99% of the Unreduxing work, and porting the last maps </3)
